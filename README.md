# 🛠 cher-ami toolbox

Local and external tools collection for cher-ami projects.

This README contains two types of tools:

- Local and NOT published tools (available on this repository)
- Externals and published tools ↗

## Why not publish tools of this repo on npm?

Because some tools need to be re-handled according to use, without that we want to re-develop them from scratch.
If a tool or component can be customized only via parameters, it should not have its place in this repository but become an independent library.
