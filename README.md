# Toolbox

[![lerna](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20with-lerna-cc00ff.svg)](https://lerna.js.org/)

Reusable tools for cher-ami projects.
These tools are **not published on npm and not compiled**. You have to copy/past the selected tool in your cher-ami project.

## Why not published on npm?

Because some tools need to be re-handled according to use, without that we want to re-develop them from scratch.
If a tool or component can be customized only via parameters, it should not have its place in this repository but become an independent library.

## How to contribute?

- Copy/past the template in the corresponding folder of your tool
- Add name and description in package.json / README.md
- Add your tool in src
- Create an example in "\_example" folder if needed. A vitejs project is setup in each package, ready to be.
- If you create a new folder in [packages](packages) folder, add it in the [lerna.json](lerna.json) file.
- Add the new tool in main [README.md](README.md) file.
